-secondchess is a derivative of firstchess

-Its main aim is to add the neccesary code to firstchess in order
to make it play real chess, especially adding the rules for castle and en 
passant capture, focusing in an easy to read code.

-To compile under linux just "gcc secondchess.c -o secondchess -Ofast"
